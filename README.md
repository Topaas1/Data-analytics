# Data-analytics

This repository contains my data analytics projects. Their purpose is to provide a glimpse into how I work with data, from cleaning and preparation to analysis and visualization of results. Together, they aim to demonstrate my problem-solving approach and analytical thinking.

The data used in these projects is either sourced from the public domain or is fictional data created by me. As such, no copyrights or privacy rights are violated.
